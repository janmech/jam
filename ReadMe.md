# jam
The jam package consists of two externals for [Cycling'74 Max](https://cycling74.com) for connecting to and controlling ENTTEC DMX USB Pro devices. `jam.dmxusbpro` and `jam.dmxusbpro~`. The former allows sending DMX data to and receiving them from a connectect interface using Max messages. The latter allows to send DMX data via audio signals.

The project was born out of curiosity, wanting to learn how to write Max externals. I chose to create the DMX USB Pro objects, because the formerly wide spread external by nullmedium ([http://www.nullmedium.de/dev/dmxusbpro/](http://www.nullmedium.de/dev/dmxusbpro/)) is end of life since a while and there are frequently people on the Max Forum looking for a replacement.
